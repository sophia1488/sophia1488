- 👋 Hi, I’m Yi-Hui (Sophia) Chou, 周奕慧.  I'm now a Research Scientist at Zoom. Before that, I received my master's at [Language Technologies Institute, CMU](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) and my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering (EE) from National Taiwan University (NTU), Taiwan.
- 👧🏻 Pronouns: She/Her
- 👀 My research interests broadly lie in the field of NLP/speech/audio/music AI, and I'm open to collaborate on related interesting projects.  
- 🎼 I'm a music lover ([a piano-trio performance by my friends and me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4iPHfb2tI&list=PLWxD9JBT-P09TzTE_kozSU4TOXfiVPGTA&index=11)). To me, music is also a language. I'm fascinated how artists express their feelings through music, just like writers creates a new world through words.
